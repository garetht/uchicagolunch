        <ul>
            <li><p class="bold">Where did the idea come from?</p>
                <p>UChicago.Lunch is inspired by <a href="http://harvardlunch.com">HarvardLunch</a>. After seeking wisdom from its creator,
                we decided to take the best of that site and combine it with some of our own special sauce: automated scheduling, restaurant suggestions,
                and more.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p class="bold">Is UChicago.Lunch a dating site?</p>
                <p>Only in a platonic sense (read: NOT romantic). We aim only to help students meet people they might not have met otherwise,
                and to expand the dining options available to UChicago students.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p class="bold">What restaurants have you included?</p>
                <p>Our restaurant list was compiled using a combination of the Chicago Life dining guide, Yelp, and personal knowledge.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p class="bold">Is the restaurant and meeting time that I was given set in stone?</p>
                <p>Not at all! We encourage people to contact their lunch dates if another time or place would be preferable.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p class="bold">I don't like my restaurant or meeting time. What should I do?</p>
                <p>Please contact your lunch date and inform them. UChicago.Lunch is a matching service only and is not able to resolve
                   individual conflicts.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p class="bold">When do I know if I get matched / How much advance notice do I get?</p>
                <p>Due to the randomized nature of our matching algorithm, we are not able to provide specific timeframes. However,
                   you will usually be notified via email several hours before the time of your lunch date.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p class="bold">How long does my request stay in the system?</p>
                <p>If we are not able to match you, your request expires on the latest day you selected for your availability.</p>
            </li>
